### **Wins & Challenges**
---
Figuring out how to iterate through the hash to figure out the diagonals took a lot of time to figure out. We attempted a few times before settling with what we have now. It took a few refactors to get to where it's now and althought there could be better ways, it works and considered a WIN!

Ruby Gem had it's own challenges, understanding how and what's needed to have a gem working, as well as, using the gem outside of IRB/Pry.

### **Future Iterations**
---
1. Having an exit message displayed when trying to exit during a column_full check.
1.  Computer winning or blocking when the last piece is not an edge piece.
1. Ending game as soon as player is winner and not allowing computer another turn.
